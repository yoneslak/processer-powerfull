Robust Processing Theory for Artificial Intelligence-Assisted Text Processing: A Case Study on Topic Modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation

Abstract

This paper presents a robust processing theory for artificial intelligence-assisted text processing, focusing on topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We demonstrate a comprehensive framework for text preprocessing, feature extraction, artificial intelligence model creation, and post-processing. Our implementation utilizes scikit-learn's TfidfVectorizer and LatentDirichletAllocation to perform topic modeling on a list of text samples. We visualize the results using word clouds and a heatmap, providing insights into the topic weights and relationships between topics and words.










Introduction

Artificial intelligence-assisted text processing has become increasingly important in various applications, including information retrieval, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling. A robust processing theory is essential for developing accurate and efficient text processing systems. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for topic modeling using LDA, a widely used technique for extracting underlying topics from large text corpora.















Methodology

Our implementation consists of the following steps:

Text Preprocessing: We load a list of 10 text samples into a text_data variable. We create a TF-IDF vectorizer using scikit-learn's TfidfVectorizer, removing English stop words and transforming the text data into numerical features.
LDA Model Creation: We create an LDA model with 10 topics using scikit-learn's LatentDirichletAllocation. We fit the model to the TF-IDF features using the fit method.
Topic Weight Extraction: We extract topic weights for each feature from the LDA model using the components_ attribute.
Feature Names Extraction: We receive the feature names (words) from the vectorizer using the get_feature_names_out method.
Topic Words Extraction: We create a topic_words dictionary to store the top 10 words for each topic. We iterate over the topics using np.argsort and extract the top 10 words for each topic.
Word Cloud Generation: We create a word cloud for each topic using the WordCloud library, setting the width and height to 800 pixels, the random seed to 21, and the maximum font size to 110.
Topic Weight Visualization: We use the Seaborn clustermap function to visualize the topic weights as a heatmap, setting the colormap to viridis and the size of the shape to (10, 10).


Results

Our implementation outputs 10 word clouds, one for each topic, showing the top 10 words for each topic. We also output a heatmap showing topic weights and relationships between topics and words.

Conclusion

This paper presents a comprehensive framework for topic modeling using LDA, highlighting the importance of careful preprocessing, feature extraction, and model selection. Our implementation serves as a foundation for developing robust text processing systems, providing insights into the topic weights and relationships between topics and words. Future work will focus on extending this framework to other text processing tasks and exploring the application of our robust processing theory in various domains.

Code Breakdown

The provided code is an implementation of a topic modeling processor using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and visualizes the results using word clouds and a heatmap. Here's a breakdown of the code:



Text Preprocessing

The code loads a list of 10 text samples into a text_data variable.
It creates a TF-IDF vectorizer using scikit-learn's TfidfVectorizer.
The vectorizer is fitted to the text data and transformed into numerical features using the fit_transform method.
The stop_words='english' parameter specifies that English stop words (common words like "the", "and", etc.) should be removed from the text data.
LDA Model Creation

The code creates an LDA model with 10 topics using scikit-learn's LatentDirichletAllocation.
The model is fitted to the TF-IDF features using the fit method.
Topic Weight Extraction

The code extracts topic weights for each feature from the LDA model using the components_ attribute.
Feature Names Extraction

The code receives the feature names (words) from the vectorizer using the get_feature_names_out method.


Topic Words Extraction

The code creates a topic_words dictionary to store the top 10 words for each topic.
It iterates over the topics using np.argsort and extracts the top 10 words for each topic.
It creates a string of top words for each topic and adds it to the topic_words dictionary.
